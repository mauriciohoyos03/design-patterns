/*
It would be easy to understand prototype design pattern with an example.
Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this
data in our program multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using
new keyword and load all the data again from database.

The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then
do the data manipulation.
